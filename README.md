## üìñ How to build and run ?

1. Install the dependencies

   1. Inventory (if needed)
   2. Replace variables
   3. Encrypt the needed ones

   --vault-password-file .vault_pass \
   main.yml

## ‚ö†Ô∏è knockd risks

In this configuration, we are using `knockd` to manage the openSSH firewall (`ufw`) rules. It can be very risky. If you want to be safe you can exclude the `knockd` task by commenting the following line in [roles/security/tasks/main.yml](roles/security/tasks/main.yml):

```sh
- include_tasks: knockd.yml
```

And then add a rule for `ufw` that allow you SSH connections.
